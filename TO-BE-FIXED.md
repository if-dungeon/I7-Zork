# Issues in the Original Game to be Fixed in the Translation
## General
1. In the original, "examine" and "look at" are separate commands but the responses to each are not necessarily set up correctly.
## The White House in the Forest
1. The windows in the north and south side of the house are not in scope. This has been [fixed](https://github.com/heasm66/mdlzork/pull/30) in the original source code.
