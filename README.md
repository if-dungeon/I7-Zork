# Zork - The Pre-Infocom Classic
The aim of this project is to understand the design of Zork by means of re-engineering.

The objectives are as follows.
* Zork will be re-written in Inform 7 to represent it's design in a more easily understood, "natural-language" form.
* Gameplay of the Inform 7 version will be compared with that of the original to demonstrate fidelity of translation.
* Notes, maps and puzzle dependency graphs will be produced to document the design.

## Technical Context
Inform 7 v 10.1.0 has recently been made [open-source](https://intfiction.org/t/inform-7-v10-1-0-is-now-open-source/55674).
This presents an opportunity to use Inform 7 as implemented by the very latest version of the Inform compiler.
The specifics of this project are as follows.

### Languages
* [MDL](https://mdl-language.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* [Inform 7](https://ganelson.github.io/inform-website/)

### Platforms
* Windows 10 / Cygwin

### Resources
* [Mainframe Zork for Confusion (latest)](https://github.com/heasm66/mdlzork)
* [Cygwin (latest)](https://www.cygwin.com/)
* [Inform compiler version 10.2.0-beta 'Krypton' (latest)](https://github.com/ganelson/inform)
* [Windows Inform 7 (latest)](https://github.com/zil-transformation/Windows-Inform7)

## Practical Issues
Although one of the objectives of this project is to demonstrate fidelity of translation, the original source code has some problems which it would be undesirable to duplicate. Where this is the case, [fixes](https://github.com/zil-transformation/Zork/blob/main/TO-BE-FIXED.md) will be incorporated in the translation.

## Release Plan
### Beta
1. Add Chapter 1 (The White House in the Forest)
2. Add Chapter 2 (Inside the White House)
3. Add Chapter 3 (Beneath the White House)

The content and number of further releases will be decided when necessary.
