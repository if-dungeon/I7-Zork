# Zork - The Pre-Infocom Classic
The aim of this project is to understand the design of Zork by means of re-engineering.

The objectives are as follows.
* Zork will be re-written in Inform 7 to represent it's design in a more easily understood, "natural-language" form.
* Gameplay of the Inform 7 version will be compared with that of the original to demonstrate fidelity of translation.
* Notes, maps and puzzle dependency graphs will be produced to document the design.

## Technical Context
Inform 7 v 10.1.0 has recently been made [open-source](https://intfiction.org/t/inform-7-v10-1-0-is-now-open-source/55674).
This presents an opportunity to use Inform 7 as implemented by the very latest version of the Inform compiler.
The specifics of this project are as follows.
