Version 1 of Zork Move Counting by Alex Proudfoot begins here.

"Reproduces the move counting behaviour of the original game."

Use authorial modesty.

To decide which number is the move count:
	if the story has not ended:
		decide on the turn count - 1;
	otherwise:
		decide on the turn count;

Zork Move Counting ends here.

---- DOCUMENTATION ----

This extension implements move counting, which starts at 0, as opposed to turn counting, which starts at 1.
